BBC 3 made a three-episode documentary using VR to show mental health exploring borderline personality disorder, anorexia and bulimia and psychotic depression, this series interested me as it was the creators showing their mental illness through VR giving us a glimpse into how their minds work and allowing people to understand what is going on more clearly. The Psychotic depression episode shows a Danika explaining what she went through during her darkest time, she was able to draw how she felt during her time at the hospital, She talks about not wanting to be on medication and putting harsh chemicals into her body “almost felt like I was on a drip, but the drip was poison and this green chemicals and poison just taken over my whole body” (Kent, 2021) whilst saying this she draws an IV bag with green and connects it to her arm to show the viewer just how she felt and what was going through her head at the time. The end of the video you see her drawing a wilted flower as that’s how she described the feeling she had to her family “I remember actually using a visual image of a wilted to show how this depression had taken over my life” (Kent, 2021) VR helped her to show and explain exactly how her depression was making her feel.

But what if VR wasn’t helping to reduce anxiety? “Of course, there’s a case to be made that VR therapy simply cannot be as effective as real-life situation exposure – no matter how fine-tuned it is – because the patient will always know that the situation they’re in isn’t real.” This is a risk but like all therapies some styles work for some while they don’t work for others because of fear your brain can get overwhelmed by the images being seen so you may not have the thought of this isn’t real as quickly as you would if you weren’t being over whelmed with that fear element, Tewari say “People do know it’s not real, but your instinct reacts quicker than the logical parts of your brain. If you have a fear of heights and we simulate that environment in VR, you get stressed before your brain can logically say ‘hang on, this is just a VR headset, this isn’t real’. It’s also important for some people to know that it’s not real – if they didn’t know there was a degree of fantasy then they just wouldn’t do it, it would be too scary for them.”

Another form of anxiety that can affect people’s day to day lives is phobias, they can range from many different scenario’s like getting on a plane, meeting friends, going outside but it can even effect people’s lives medically a phobia of needles can make someone avoid any time of injection they need for example a vaccine, a phobia of enclosed spaces could prevent an individual from getting an MRI that could save their lives. “Previously, practitioners would work with an individual to build up exposure to their phobia by watching videos or finding a stimulus in the real world.
Reeve explained that virtual reality made the experience more realistic than videos and had the added benefit that the experience could be altered or stopped at any time.
“We are also able to completely control the virtual environment, such as changing the weather conditions for someone who is scared of flying, which can really help to prepare them to face every possible scenario in their everyday lives”” (Hughes, 2020) VR could help reduce phobias by allowing a clinician to help guide the user through their anxiety and fear by showing them their phobia whilst allowing them and the user to be in full control of what happens at all times, this is why VR could potentially be more beneficial then real world experiences as there is more control over the situation.

Meditation has been used for many years as a way for people to reach inner peace “Mindfulness meditation has met increasing interest as a therapeutic strategy for anxiety disorders, ... This is the first randomized, controlled trial comparing the manualized Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program with an active control for Generalized Anxiety Disorder, a disorder characterized by chronic worry and physiological hyperarousal symptoms.” (Hoge et al., 2013) This study looked at how meditation could reduce anxiety not many of these studies have been done, it looked at a random group meditating for a period then tested their anxiety and stress levels for days after their meditation session. “These results suggest that MBSR may have a beneficial effect on anxiety symptoms in GAD, and may also improve stress reactivity and coping as measured in a laboratory stress challenge.” (Hoge et al., 2013)  The study only concluded meditation may have an impact on reducing anxiety and stress, but this study was important for the start of more people looking into the wellbeing of meditation for anxiety, it lead this look into VR being used for meditation instead, “The problem with anxiety, of course, is that it makes my mind extra jumpy and extra ready to yank right out of the Zen bliss of meditation and into a hurricane of worries and to-dos. For this reason, unassisted silent meditation is, I believe, particularly difficult for people with anxiety.
Virtual reality helps me overcome this by engaging my senses. With a vista of gorgeous scenery before my eyes and music in my ears, I’m far better able to center myself in the moment than when I try to clear my head of my own volition.
VR gives me something to focus on besides the anxious or intrusive thoughts that constantly vie for headspace.” (Garone, 2019)

SAD= Social anxiety disorder
RCT= Randomised control trial
CBT= Cognitive behavioural therapy 

People doing therapy can easily benefit from VR “VR treatment research has been conducted for anxiety disorders, and broadly, results suggest the VRE is related to large declines in anxiety symptoms, demonstrates similar efficacy compared to traditional exposure interventions, has a powerful real-life impact, and demonstrates good stability of results over time.” (Maples-Keller, Bunnell, Kim and Rothbaum, 2017) being able to safely go through real life anxiety triggers is what VR is best for allowing people to be able to work through their anxiety at their own pace and safely.

Long waiting lists suggests that peoples mental health can suffer as they are going undiagnosed or untreated for a long period of time leaving them trapped in their own minds “There is evidence that treatment gains made in VRE generalize to real life, as meta-analytic results suggest that VRE patients, compared to wait-list patients, perform significantly better on behavioral assessments post-treatment, and found no significant differences between VRE and in-vivo exposure at post-treatment and follow up.” (Maples-Keller, Bunnell, Kim and Rothbaum, 2017) VR is easily assessable with the option of google cardboard and the oculus quest this means that more users can use VR to help with their mental health as there is no waiting list, an app that can give them real life experiences can be developed and tailor made to the user this suggests they will do significantly better after treatment as they have had treatment faster and sometimes more efficiently.

Children always struggle with school but it’s worse when the child has anxiety “VR-based interventions for SAD typically involve the use of computer-generated social environments (e.g., classrooms, auditoriums, conference rooms) with virtual audiences. In examination of generalized SAD, two RCTs found VR-based CBT to be as effective as traditional CBT and superior to control conditions. VR-based CBT for fear of public speaking has demonstrated effects similar to traditional CBT and above that of controls and effects were maintained at one-year post treatment. Finally, preliminary data has begun to show efficacy for VR in the treatment of school-based anxiety, including test anxiety.” (Maples-Keller, Bunnell, Kim and Rothbaum, 2017) This could help a child get back into education and help them even achiever higher grades within school, giving children this type of therapy even in school could be more effective and reach more kids.

“In a virtual simulation of a school setting children are first trained in school related-coping skills and practice in this environment until they achieve satisfactory responses. In pursuit of the same objective, our re- search group has developed a series of virtual reality environments which can be integrated in a treatment program for children and adolescents with school phobia.” (Gutiérrez-Maldonado, José y Magallón-Neri, Ernesto y Rus-Calafell, Mar y Peñaloza-Salazar, Claudia y, 2009)

“Anxiety trigger elements and situations included in the environments were selected based on the most updated scientific literature related to the school fears and concerns more frequently found, and the results obtained in the first administration of the IME and FSSC-R. Each environment was divided into two levels of interaction, an “easy” level with a moderate performance demanded including stimuli provoking low levels of anxiety with indulgent authority roles, and a “difficult” level with an increasing amount of anxious stimulation, the presence of intimidating avatars and demanding authority roles, and the increasing amount of school performance requirements.” (Gutiérrez-Maldonado, José y Magallón-Neri, Ernesto y Rus-Calafell, Mar y Peñaloza-Salazar, Claudia y, 2009)

“The virtual reality exposure treatment used in the present study was able to reduce the intensity of school-related fears significantly, but did not influence general fears in a significant manner. These results show that the impact of treatment can be considered to be specific, particularly influencing on school- related fears and on its social component. Given than virtual environments were developed based on the inclusion of anxiety trigger stimuli usually found at school, results show its validity as a specific treatment for fears in this set- ting. …Taken together, these results allow us to suggest the use of virtual reality exposure as an important tool among the rest of techniques for the treatment of school phobia.” (Gutiérrez-Maldonado, José y Magallón-Neri, Ernesto y Rus-Calafell, Mar y Peñaloza-Salazar, Claudia y, 2009)

“Perhaps the most significant advantage of VR therapies is that they can be automated. This means that in VR there can be a virtual coach with you who explains the therapy and teaches you the psychological techniques to try out.” (Brown, 2021)

“Virtual coaches like Nic can work like a therapist without a therapist actually needing to be present at every VR session. Instead, a graduate psychologist or peer supporter (such as someone who has lived through a similar experience) can lead the sessions with the user, providing support and guidance alongside the virtual coach.” (Brown, 2021)

“to build a VR simulation that would efficiently and effectively train medical students and staff to respond in high-stakes, low-frequency pediatric emergencies.” (VR, 2018)

““Currently, we’re only able to run critical events such as pediatric resuscitation training two to four times per year since we cannot take our teams away from patient care more frequently,” says Kathryn Schaivone (MHA, CHSE) of Kaiser Permanente. “VR levels the playing field in a way that doesn’t happen with in-person methods and provides the flexibility for more frequent participation in simulation.”” (VR, 2018)
